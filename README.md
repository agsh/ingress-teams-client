# Ingress-teams-client

Project to share info about portal keys between team members. Client part is based on
[IngressLiveInventory](https://github.com/EisFrei/IngressLiveInventory) plugin and has
the same id, so it replaces the original version.
For now this is a very early version.

## Plugin installation & features

Add plugin from https://github.com/agsh/IngressLiveInventory/raw/main/liveInventory.user.js
Then you'll see two new menu items in the portal info: `Inventory` and `Teams`.

![Portal info](https://github.com/agsh/ingress-teams-client/raw/main/img/f.png "Portal info")

* Add server address and team token at the bottom of the `Inventory` menu

* Then upload your stats by pressing `Upload Keys` button from the `Inventory` menu
